* Protein synthesis
    * albumin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, transport proteins etc.
    * albumin 
        * 12-15g synthesised/day; Total pool 500g
        * rate of production determined by plasma oncotic pressure

* Protein catabolism - ie in starvation; gluconeogenesis - deamination produces substrates for TCA cycle; ammonium produced must be exreted via Urea Cycle
    * Certain aa (eg leucine, isoleucine, phenyalanine, tyrosine) ketogenic b/c deamination produces acetoacetate (ketone body)
    * Certain aa (eg alanine etc) gluconeogenic because deamination produces products (eg pyruvate) that can be converted to glucose

## Urea cycle

- Periportal process: 3ATP needed per urea)

1. Ammonia (as carbamoyl phosphate) combines with ornithine and produces citrulline (ornithine carbamoyltransferase)
2. Ornithine regenerated and urea produced in urea cycle

    * Glutaminase and NH4+ balance (Glutamine + H2O <--> Glutamate + NH3)
    * Brain: glutamate mops up excess ammonia and prevents toxicity
    * Kidney: glutamamine converted into glutamate; ammonia excreted into urine where it buffers H+ (becomes NH4+) and hence reaction goes to the right - H+ ions and NH3 successfully excreted

* Liver Failure: urea cycle functions (NH3 not converted into urea) poorly hence blood NH3 lvls rise (encephalopathy)
