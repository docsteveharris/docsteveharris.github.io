I was asked by a colleague yesterday if there were any resources on the internet to help learn R. I feel that that should have an answer crafted by someone like [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/about/) along the lines of 'What if you tried to count the number of ways there are to learn R'?

Whatever that number is, it's now +1.

I'll start with an unordered list. If we're all lucky, then from time to time, I will try and order it so the good stuff goes to the top.

# Tips

- [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is nice!
- Typing `<-` is annoying if you're used to `-` as an assignment operator. R-studio has this remapped to `option+-` (that's 'alt' and the hyphen key together). You can set-up something similar in SublimeText or the text editor of your choice.


# Opinion

- I don't like the use of the `.` (dot) as part of variable names. To me, it normally means I am accessing properties of an object. In R, it has no such significance.
