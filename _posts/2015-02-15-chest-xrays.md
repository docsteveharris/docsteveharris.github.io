### Basics

- Patient position (look for 'inclinometers: patient supine or upright, and some with dots that indicated the angle of the head of the bed')
- lung volumes: should see 10 ribs (count posterior, and remember that commonly the first seen behind the right apex is the third)
- Well centred? Spinous process between medial head of clavicle
- well penetrated? (just) see intervertebral disc spaces through mediastinum

### Line position

- tip of central lines should be at the caval-atrial border (where bronchus intermedius crosses above right side of heart); note this is lower than alternative recommendation of between clavicles and carina
- ETT tubes: 2--6cm above carina (and below the clavicular heads)
- carina should be at T6 level (and can sometimes be found by drawing a 45 degree line from the aortic knuckle)

### Locating abnormalities

Think anterior and posterior in terms of silhouettes

- ie descending aorta is posterior so check for silhouette to define a-p position on left? @good
- ditto with hilum
- Right middle lobe is anterior with heart hence silhouette affects right heart border
- right lower lobe is a posterior and sits on diaphragm hence lose diaphragm
- left upper lobe is anterior
- left lower lobe posterior
