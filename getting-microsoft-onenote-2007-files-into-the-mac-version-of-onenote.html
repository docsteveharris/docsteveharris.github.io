    <p>So I have just spent an entire evening extracting the data from my old Microsoft OneNote 2007 files. This was quite a task so I thought I would document my notes here. If I had had access to a Windows 8 machine then it would have been easier. As I understand it, OneNote 2013 on a Windows machine will simply open a OneNote 2007 file. That file can then be uploaded to Microsoft Onedrive, and then ‘hey presto’, I would have had access to it back on my Mac.</p>
<p>Instead I have Windows XP and OneNote 2007 running inside a VMware Fusion (version 4) virtual machine. I could also have bought Windows 8 and upgraded VMware Fusion to version 6, and saved myself all the trouble. With an academic discount, and upgrade pricing, that would still have cost me £85. It would possibly have been worth it had I needed Windows for anything else, but for now I don’t.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a copy of Office 2010 after a lot of googling. Most of these are illegal and come with keygens and cracks, but you can avoid problems if you just use it for the 29 day trial period. I installed this on the Windows XP virtual machine (after upgrading to Service Pack 3). I then opened my old OneNote 2007 folders one by one, and by clicking on the properties menu item, selected the option to upgrade them to the 2010 file format.</p>
<p>These 2010 version files can now be opened and edited by <a href="http://outline.ws/">Outline</a> (a Mac version of OneNote). The 2007 files were read only.</p>
<p>I could have stopped there, but Outline also connects to Onedrive so I copied the sections of the notebooks over to empty new notebooks I had created on Onedrive. These are now available to the Mac version of OneNote.</p>
<p>About six hours of work. Not really sure that it wouldn’t have been better to have spent the £80.</p>
<h2>Quick list of thing's I learnt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Neither Outline nor Mac OneNote can be searched by Spotlight (as of 18 Apr 2014)</li>
<li>Only the text content of a table is copied to the clipboard when working with Outline. Mac OneNote gets this right</li>
<li>You can't rename OneNote notebooks in Outline (at least those that are saved on Onedrive)</li>
</ul>
