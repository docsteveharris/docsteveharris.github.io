I was asked by a colleague yesterday if there were any resources on the internet to help learn R. I feel that that should have an answer crafted by someone like [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/about/) along the lines of 'What if you tried to count the number of ways there are to learn R'?

Whatever that number is, it's now +1.

I'll start with an unordered list. If we're all lucky, then from time to time, I will try and order it so the good stuff goes to the top.
