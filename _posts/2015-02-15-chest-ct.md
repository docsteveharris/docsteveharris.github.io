## CT

Set-up your windows by using Hounsfield units:
    1. Set as window width (WW)
    2. Set window level (WL) which represents the midpoint is midpoint

Useful Hounsfield values

- 0 is water
- -1000 is air
- 3000 is bone
- fat -100 to -50
- blood 30-45
- soft tissue is approx 80 (this is the typical window setting on

CT chest types

+ non-contrast for lung parenchyma
+ high res (HRCT) for ILD (1-1.5mm slices)
+ contrast for mediasteinum and pleura

### Contrast scans

- Seconds for vascular structures
- minutes for tissue
- double phase for arterial and venous
- triple phase for hepatic? Portal structures
- Bolus tracking if timing is difficult in ICU patients with odd cardiac output where scan is of poor quality with standard timing
- Nephropathy may occur even if on haemodialysis!

## Terminology

+ reticular
+ nodular
+ high attenuation (bright densities)
    * ground glass (GGO): less dense increase which does not obscure the vessels
    * consolidation: dense increase in opacity, obscures vessels
+ low attenuation (low densities)
    * emphysema
    * cystic lung disease

## CT anatomy

+ secondary lobules key for understanding disease
    * 1--2cm in diameter
    * made up ofr 5--15 acini
    * surrounded by lymphatics and pulmonary veins that return in the interlobular septae
    * centred on terminal bronchiole: accompanied by pulmonary artery - centrilobular artery

![secondary pulmonary lobule]({{base.url}}/assets/media/150215_secondary_pulmonary_lobule.png)

+ centrilobular area is site for diseases that enter via the airways
+ perilymphatics - peripheral part and pathology follows the lymphatics
    * septial thicknening = reticular pattern
        - smooth - fluid
        - nodular: silicosis, sarcoidosis
        - NB: lymphangitic carcinomatosis can create either process

## Classification

Triangulate pattern and distribution (wrt to the secondary lobule), and distribution (with respect to the lung)

What is the  dominant pattern?

- reticular
- nodular
- ground glass
- high attenuation
- low attenuation

What is the distribution with respect to

- the secondary lobule
- within the lung

### Nodules

Distribution wrt to 2ndary lobule (centrilobular vs perilymphatic, random)

+ e.g. centriobular: in the centre of the connective tissue margins of the secondary lobule (look for space between nodule and pleura)
    * hypersensitivity pneumonitis
    * infectious disease
    * brnochioalveolar cancer
    * NB: an extension of this is 'tree in bud' sign where the terminal bronchiole is inflamed and thickened - think TB, CF, bronchiectasis, ABPA; i.e. inflammation of distal airways)
+ e.g. perilymhatic: along edges
+ random: miliary TB, fungi, metastases

Distribution wrt lung (upper zone, lower, central, peripheral)

+ upper vs lower
+ central vs peripheral

### Ground glass opacities (GGO)

+ acute: pulmonary oedema, ARDS, pneumonia (esp viral)
+ chronic: hypersensitivity pneumonitis; alveolar proteinoisis

### High attenuation

Think of this as a denser form of GGO and the differential must be one of blood, pus, cancer, water (oedema)

Further diagnostic refinement will depend on the history, and the next most important question is time course (acute vs chronic)

### Low attenuation

+ bronchiectasis (dilated bronchioles)
+ cavities (walls greater than 4mm)
    * final stages = honeycombing (differential: interstitial lung disease including drugs and connective tissue)
        - see associated traction bronchiectasis
+ cysts (walled areas <4mm)
+ emphysema (not walled)
    * paraseptal: adjacent to the pleura and interlobar fissures
        - young adults with spontaneous pneumothorax
        - also seen in older smokers (spectrum of centrilobular below)
    * panlobular: affects whole lobulue but lower lobes >> upper lobes
        - think alpha-1 anti-trypsin
        - smokers with advanced emphysema
    * centrilobular
        - most common
        - upper lobe predominance
        - uneven distribution
        - smokers
