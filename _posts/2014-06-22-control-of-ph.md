There are a number of factors which can disturb pH of the body, and a number of mechanisms to preserve this pH homeostasis.Threats to pH homeostasis1. Production of CO22. Production of sulphate from amino acid thiol groups3. Production of phosphate from phosholipid metabolismMechanisms of Compensation1. Imidazole Alpha-Stat: Defends against temperature induced changes in pN2. Chemical Buffers3. Respiratory control of PaCO24. Renal & Hepatic control of acid secretion## Threats to pH Homeostasis### Production of CO2CO2 is produced by the oxidation of carbon-hydrogen bonds in sugars, lipids and proteins. One molecule of CO2 is produced per molecule of O2 during the oxidation of carbohydrates hence the respiratory quotient is 1. The respiratory quotient (CO2/O2) of lipids is approximately 0.7, and proteins is 0.8. Basal production of CO2 is on average 1~1.5mmol/kg/day. whereas lipids and proteins require more oxygen for their Carbohydrates produce one molecule of CO2 per carbon atom (and one molecule of H2O) and therefore their respiratory quotient is 1. CO2 production is roughly 200ml/min or 180 moles/kg/day.### Production of non-volatile acidsThere is high turnover of non-volatile acids including ketone bodies and lactate, but only a small fraction of this is not metaboised and must be excreted. Principally, metabolism of thiol and phosphate groups to sulphate and phosphate respectively amounts to 1--1.5mmol/kg/day or 100mmol/day of acid that must be excreted by the kidneys.## Mechanisms of Compensation### Imidazole Alpha Stat (see Importance of pH)### Chemical BuffersThe buffering capacity of the body is enormous and because it is physico-chemical it is very rapid. In an experiment where dogs were infused with 14millimol H+ per litre body water pH only changed from 7.44 to 7.14 (i.e. from 36nmol to 72nmol); i.e. despite adding 14 000 000 nanomoles of H+, the H+ concentration changed only by 36 nanomoles. Importantly then changes in pH do not reflect proportionately changes in the underlying metabolic processes that produce H+ ions. It is better to look at the changes in the concentration of the constituents of the buffers of which bicarbonate concentration is that which is most easily available.The principal buffers in the body are proteins including haemoglobin, bicarbonate, phosphate, and calcium carbonate. These need to be considered in terms of the potency, their distribution inside and outside cells, and their speed of response.Bicarbonate: Present in all compartments (plasma, ICF, ISF), pKa 6.1 therefore impotent as a chemical buffer but important its concentration is under ventilatory controlProteins: Imidazole groups on histidine are principally responsible for the buffering capacity of proteins, pKa 6.8 which is close to pHi (intracellular pH 6.8-7.1); Differences in the tertiary structure of deoxyhaemoglobin mean that it is a better buffer than oxyhaemoglobin (Haldane Effect)Phosphate: principally an intracellular anion but also significant in buffering urine pH, pKa 6.8 therefore an important bufferCalcium Carbonate: Bone, not strictly in solution therefore a slow response, but provides buffering capacity in long term acidosis: Calcium Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 / Carbonate crystal. s : Hence huge pool of Carbonate etc that can exchange with plasma: hence chronic acidosis buffered ion-exchange (H+ exchanged for Ca2+ etc) or by Dissolution of bone crystal (release Ca, Bicarb, Phosphate) via direct chemical effects (independent of PTH) (ie Renal Osteodystrophy)### Respiratory Control of PaCO2Once again imidazole groups on histidine residues probably act as the pH sensor in the respiratory sensor that increases minute ventilation to compensate for acidosis, and to maintain a constant PaCO2. Hence an increase in CO2 production (VCO2) or the prescence of exogenous acid will augment ventilation (PaCO2 = 0.863 x (VCO2 (mls/min) / VA (litres/min).## Renal and Hepatic Control of Acid secretion### Renal Regulation & Acid Base HandlingNet acid excretion is the sum of titratable acidity (TA) and NH4+ less any HCO3- not reabsorbed2 important functions - both occur in PCT1. Reabsorption of Filtered Bicarb2. Excretion of fixed acids / Ammonium Production### Reabsorption of Filtered BicarbPCT: High capacity - Low Gradient System - uses Na+ gradientPCT 85% reabsorped; 10-15% in LoH and 5% in DCTEssential Componentsa. Luminal & Intracellular Carbonic Anhydrase (CA)b. Basolateral Na/K ATPasec. Luminal Na/H antiport    Na/K ATPase sets up gradient for Na reabsorption which is done with exchange of H+ into lumen which via CA combines with Bicarb to produce CO2 which diffuses into the cell and again via CA regenerates Bicarb; Hence net absorption of Na and HCO3; No net change in HCO3 balance    Controlled by luminal flow rate and bicarb conc and arterial CO2; also stimulated by Angiotensin II; Inhibited by PTH    DCT: Low capacity - High gradient system - uses ATP    DCT Bicarb reabsorption a little different: uses H+ATPase pump and a HCO3-/Cl- Symport### Ammonium ProductionGlutamine --> Glutamate + NH4+ --> alpha-ketoglutarate --> 2 HCO3-Note: acid produced (pKa NH4+ 9.2 so entirely ionised and not freely diffusible); Bicarb also produced de novo:NH4+ actively pumped out of Thick LoH; so low NH4+ conc in DCT; Hence part of the concentrating mech of medulla; also distal medullary collecting tubule is variably permeable and hence NH4+ can be excretedNH4+ production is controlled and accounts for most of the adaptive change in chronic acidosis; Titrable acidity (see below) cannot be increased beyond the amt of Pi that is filtered and hence is more rapidly limiting### Titratable AcidityDirect excretion of H+ using proton pump (H+ATPase as in stomach); Buffered by tubular Pi (and Creatinine as pH approaches 4.2 limit)Ketone bodies can contribute as buffers too in DKA and increase the urinary excretion of H+## Control of Renal H+ Excretion1. Extracellular Volume: Volume depletion leads to Na+ retention which enhances HCO3 reabsorption2. Arterial PaCO2: Incr PaCO2 incr renal (PCT) H+ excretion and therefore HCO3 reabsorption3. K & Cl Deficiency:4. Aldosterone & Cortisol: via Na - hyperaldosteronism means incr Na reabsorption / incr K/H loss5. Phosphate Excretion: Important for TA but little change in Pi conc therefore not controlled6. Ammonium: Acidosis promotes glutaminase action and incr NH4+ production; Several days needed for full effect of this system## Liver-Renal LinksArguement that glutamate/alpha-ketoglutarate synthesis in the kidney is not denovo production of bicarb & renal excretion of NH4+ because the glutamate was actually originally synthesised in the liver with the net loss of bicarbAlternative Point of View:1. Amino Acid / Protein turnover in the liver produces NH4+ (toxic) and HCO3- (aprox 1000mmol/day)2. NH4+ pKa 9.2 means that it remains ionised and cannot neutralise simultaneously produced Bicarb (pKa 6.1); As consequence of aa metab body now has to deal with excrete NH4+, and deal with alkalinising effect of left over HCO3-3. NH4+ in liver now has 2 pathways    1. Converted to Glutamine (effectively non-toxic carrier molecule) which is transported to kidney and converted back to NH4+ for renal excretion: Net effect is HCO3- prodn in liver and acid secretion in kidney (ie net acid secretion/bicarb formation) (i.e. glutamine: acidosis favours glutaminase which leads to ammonium (i.e. acid) loss and bicarbonate formation)    2. Urea Cycle: (Krebs-Hensleit Cycle): 2NH4+ + 2HCO3- --> Urea + CO2 + 3H2O: Urea transported to kidney and excreted: No net acid secretion or bicarb formation (1:1 ratio of bicarb:ammonium in urea cycle) (i.e. urea: no net acid or base change)Hence body chooses whether to secrete acid or not by how much it sends through urea cycle (non-acid secreting) or glutamine synthesis (acid secreting) @good@question what is the regulation of the urea cycle?## Compartmentalisation of Buffering:- ECF cannot effectively buffer respiratory disorders (CO2) b/c its principal buffer is CO2/Bicarb- ICF buffers resp disorders b/c CO2 diffuses across membranes (Protein / Pi buffers)- Proton-Cation Exchange Mechanisms: Allow extracellular H+ shifts to be buffered by the ICF: ie Na+/H+ symport and K+/H+ antiport exchange; (ie give bicarb to patients with hyperkalaemia - drives H+ out of cells and K+ in)
