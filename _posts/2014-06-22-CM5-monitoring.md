CM5 detects 89% of ST-segment changes due to left ventricular ischaemia.

Originally 

- Right arm electrode on manubrium
- Left arm electrode on V5 and indifferent lead on left shoulder
- Switch to Lead I monitoring

More easily, stay with Lead II and move RA and indifferent electrodes to manubrium and V5 as above
