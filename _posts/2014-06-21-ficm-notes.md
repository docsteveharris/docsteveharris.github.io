I am preparing for the FICM final MCQ, and going through my old FRCA revision notes. I am going to post these here mainly for my own benefit, but feel free to use them as you see fit. They should come with the usual health warnings:

- they are notes and not guaranteed to be correct!
- they have been gathered from multiple sources over several years and will rarely have the correct attributions or credits. If you think there is something which should be credited then please let me know.

At some point, I'll create an index of these notes here.
