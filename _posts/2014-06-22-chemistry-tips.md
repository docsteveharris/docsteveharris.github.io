but once halogenated (halides) then reactions much easier; halogen can be replaced with other functional groups (-OH, -NH3, -COOH etc) but the hydrocarbon carbon aka radical means the molecule retains the same chemical characteristics- Alcohols R-OH: prepared by the hydrolysis of halides (CH3-CH2-Cl + H2O --> CH3CH2OH + HCl); oxygen binds covalently to carbon forming a polar bond; hence alcohols are useful solvents because have polar (-OH) and non-polar (hydrocarbon) ends - 10 carbon alcohols and beyond are not soluble in water/n; despite -OH group these do not behave as acids/bases unless aromatic alcohol (benzene ring -OH structure ie phenol) where H+ ions may leave because the lone electron pair left can dissociate into the ring and hence the ion is stabilised ie phenolic acid (pKa 9.89); Primary alcohols have -OH attached to a terminal carbon; Secondary alcohols have the -OH attached to a Carbon bonded to 2 other carbon, tertiary to a carbon bonded to 3 other carbonds- Ethers R-O-R': dehydration of two alcohols (reduction); ie 2CH3CH2OH --(Heat/H2SO4)--> CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3 (diethyl ether) + H2O; chemically unreactive; volatile; good solvents- Ketones R-CO-R' and Aldehydes R-CO-H: Carbon-Oxygen double bonds; Oxidation of alcohols rather than reduction; Primary alcohols oxidise to aldehydes, Secondary alcohols oxidise to ketones; CO double bond is very polarised so these are reactive compounds with the carbon attacked by nucleophiles and the the oxygen attacked by electrophiles- Carboxylic Acids: R-COOH: Further oxidation of alcohols, ketones, or aldehydes; the -COO(-) ion is stabilised because the lone electron pair can dissociate with the electrons in the CO double bond; Fatty Acids are just carboxylic acids made from 10-20C hydrocarbons (ie stearic acid C17H35COOH); Soaps are just salts of fatty acids (ie Sodium Stearate (C17H35COO(-)Na+)) - the hydrocarbon chains with polar heads form monolayers; soap bubbles a sandwich of 2 monolayers with the COO- heads facing each other across a filling of water; and as the water drains out from between the layers the varying width of the film refracts light to produce the iridescent colours we see; when all the water drains away the two COO- heads come into contact - repel each other and the bubble bursts- Esters R-COO-R': Synthesised by dehydration of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid; esters are covalently bonded and stable and responsible for the pleasant odours in foods etc; they are polar and good solvents; Fats are just triesters of fatty acids and glycerol (CH2OH-CHOH-CH2OH) ie tristearin the most common animal fat is 3 stearic acid molecules attached to glycerol; saponification is the hydrolysis of the ester bonds of fats with a base (NaOH) producing glycerol and sodium stearate ((ie soap)- Amines R-NH2: Synthesised from the halide (ie ethyl chloride) and ammonia producing ethyl ammonium (C2H5-NH3+Cl-) which when added to a strong base (NaOH) becomes the simple amine (C2H5NH2); amines are weak bases and classified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on the number of carbons attached (ie choline N(CH3)4(+) is a quaternary ammonium ion); secondary and tertiary amines are toxic with fishy smells; aromatic amines (ie phenolamine) do not act as bases for the same reason that phenol-alcohol is an acid ie the dissociated electrons are reluctant to accept a positive charge which would disrupt the electron ring)- Nitrogen atoms can be directly incorporated happily into carbon rings but the free lone pair means that they act as bases (eg. purine (2 rings - adenine, guanine) and pyrimidine (1 ring - cytosine, thymine, uracil); when combined with 5-carbon ribose they form nucleosides; esterify any of the ribose -OH grps with a phosphate and you have nucleotides; esterify further phosphates (2 more) and you have ATP (ie adenosine+ribose+3 phosphates); other energy carriers (dinucelotides) have the same basic structure ie NAD (adenosine+ribose+2 phosphates+nicotinamide(niacin+ribose)), and FAD (adenosine+ribose+2 phosphates+riboflavin)- Amino Acids HOOC-CH(R)-NH3: are "zwitter ions" because the contain both a basic group (amine) and an acid group (carboxylic acid) attached to a carbon; at neutral pH both are charged and hence reactive and polymerisation occurs by dehydration; because the central carbon has 4 different groups it has two stereo-isomers (L-amino acids are those where if you follow ONwards the aa fr carbOxy grp via CH(R) to amiNo group the R group is on the Left); only L-aa are found in living organisms- Phospholipids: better than simple fatty acids because phosphate ion is bonded to the glycerol giving a greater negative charge than a simply fatty acid; electroneutrality is achieved by adding a quaternary ammonium ion (choline N(CH3)4(+)) to the head too - the result is phosphatidyl choline (choline-phosphate head with 2 14C hydrocarbon chains aka lecithin) which is the principle component of all biological membranes; in contrast to soap films the hydrocarbon tails on internal and the charged choline-phosphate heads are external- Terpenes: important grp of bioligical molecules built from isoprene units (2-methyl-1,3-butarene - ie 4 carbon chain with alternating CC double bonds and methyl grp) hence when polymerised electrons dissociate along chain; basic unti of vitamin A, chlorophyll b/c these light sensitive as double bonds flip fr cis to trans formation with about the same energy as that carried by one photon of light fr the visible spectrum (IR not energetic enough / UV too energetic and breaks other bonds too); terpene chains can be condensed into rings incl a 4 ring structure called cholesterol; terpene tail also in ubiquinone where electrons transported in respiratory chain to various cytochromes- Sugars: Cx(H2O)y: (where x and y are integers - this formula historically made people thing sugars were hydrated carbons hence the name "carbohydrates"); essentially chains of carbons with single -OH grps and a terminal aldehyde if a straight chain or the terminal oxygen double bond links to a carbon in the chain to form a ring; where the terminal O binds to the C to form a ring a chiral centre is created (-H, -OH, -O-, and -CH(OH)- groups) so ring sugars have D- and L- forms; another chiral centre produces a- and b- forms; polymers of D-glucose are starches when linked through the a- position; polymers of D-glucose form cellulose when linked through the b- position; only bacteria and protozoa contain enzymes capable of digesting cellulose; amylose is straight chain glucose polymer / starch whereas pectin and glycogen is a branched chain glucose polymer / starch- Nucleic Acids: polymers of nucleotides with an alternating sugar/phosphate backbone - and purine/pyrimidine "rungs" which form into pairs via hydrogen bonds and create the "double helix"
