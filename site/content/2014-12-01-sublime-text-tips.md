Just an aide-memoire for myself really. When referring to keybindings then I will use `C` to indicate `Command` (OS X) or `Control` (Windows).

- `C-D` expands the current selection to the next word, but it's easy to overshoot. In which case, `C-U` will undo (called a soft undo, and therefore distinct to `C-Z` and `C-shift-Z`). A soft redo is `C-shift-U`. (tip via [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2014/07/23/sublime-text-selections/)).
