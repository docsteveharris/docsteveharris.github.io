<p>Unbelievable: What ever numbers you pick are statistically 'non-random'?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You chose the numbers 09 08 07 06 45 08 07 02 77 01</p>
<p>But these are clearly not random numbers. We can tell because random numbers do not contain patterns but the numbers you entered show a fairly obvious pattern.</p>
<p>Take another look at the sequence you put in. You will see that the number of times that two neighboring numbers are within 1 point of each other is: 4. But the `expected number' from a random process is just 0.3. How odd is this pattern? Quite odd in fact. The probability that a truly random process would turn up numbers like this is just p=3e-05 (i.e. less than 1%).</p>
<p>Try again (with really random numbers this time)!</p>
<p>ps: you might think that if the p value calculated above is high (for example if it is greater than 12%) that this means that the numbers you chose are not all that odd; but in fact it means that the numbers are really particularly odd since the probability that the fishy test would produce a p values above 12%, when really random sequences are used, is low (p&lt;0.07).
