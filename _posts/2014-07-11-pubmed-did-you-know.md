I have a nagging feeling that I have always been told that I should use Ovid Medline rather than PubMed if I am doing a _serious_ search. I have just spent 10 minutes on the interweb trying to work out why. As far as I can see, Ovid is just a commercial front end for PubMed. But here's a list of tips, and pitfalls that I picked up along the way.

- pubmed: you can't put a wildcard (`?` or `*`) in the middle of the word (whereas you can in ovid)
- ovid tag syntax (`pencillin.ti`) differs from pubmed (`penicillin[ti]`)
