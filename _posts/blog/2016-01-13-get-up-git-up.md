I have been using [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) as a GUI for git, but just came across [GitUp](http://gitup.co). It starts off just looking like a pretty way to view your repository with a fairly typical graph, but you can in fact work from within the graph.

To me, this makes things seem much more intuitive since I can see where I am, and how my work fits in with previous bits of work.

Not only that it lays an undo/redo layer on top of your work. No more trying to work out how to unravel a series of misguided commits.

Worth a look.
