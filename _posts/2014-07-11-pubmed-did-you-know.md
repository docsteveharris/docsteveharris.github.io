I have a nagging feeling that I have always been told that I should use Ovid Medline rather than PubMed if I am doing a _serious_ search. I have just spent 10 minutes on the interweb trying to work out why. As far as I can see, Ovid is just a commercial front end for PubMed. But here's a list of tips, and pitfalls that I picked up along the way.

- pubmed: you can't put a wildcard (`?` or `*`) in the middle of the word (whereas you can in ovid)
- ovid tag syntax (`pencillin.ti`) differs from pubmed (`penicillin[ti]`)

# Tips

- [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is nice!
- Typing `<-` is annoying if you're used to `-` as an assignment operator. R-studio has this remapped to `option+-` (that's 'alt' and the hyphen key together). You can set-up something similar in SublimeText or the text editor of your choice.


# Opinion

- I don't like the use of the `.` (dot) as part of variable names. To me, it normally means I am accessing properties of an object. In R, it has no such significance.
