Unbelievable: What ever numbers you pick are statistically 'non-random'?

> You chose the numbers 09 08 07 06 45 08 07 02 77 01
> 
> But these are clearly not random numbers. We can tell because random numbers do not contain patterns but the numbers you entered show a fairly obvious pattern.
> 
> Take another look at the sequence you put in. You will see that the number of times that two neighboring numbers are within 1 point of each other is: 4. But the `expected number' from a random process is just 0.3. How odd is this pattern? Quite odd in fact. The probability that a truly random process would turn up numbers like this is just p=3e-05 (i.e. less than 1%).
