    <p>This blog is hosted by github. And despite their claims of this being a simple thing to do, I struggled. Things now seem to work, and I think I now have the hang of this. These are a series of notes to myself to remind me of the things I have learned.</p>
<h2>Set-up</h2>
<p>Create your github repository as you are <a href="http://pages.github.com/">told to</a>, and make sure you name it properly. The magic is that appropriately named and formatted page now pushed to this repository will be 'auto-magically' converted into a properly formatted HTML page.</p>
<p>This requires three elements.</p>
<ol>
<li>A properly named page. <code>index.md</code> is OK. And posts will need to be saved into the <code>.\_posts</code> directory with <code>CCYY-MM-DD-title.md</code> as their name. I found that <code>index.md</code> didn't compile properly unless I had put the formatted date-time into it's YAML header (see below):</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">layout</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">default</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">A little knowledge</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">date</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">2014-03-26 09:00:00 UTC</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</pre></div>


<ol>
<li>
<p>A YAML header at the top of the file. This is a list of key:value pairs on separate lines bounded above and below by three dashes <code>---</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some templates and resources that will act as default layouts. I don't know where I copied mine from originally.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>I bought the site name at <a href="www.hover.com">Hover</a>. I had to then modify the A record at Hover so that it pointed to the Github IP address which I found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/my-custom-domain-isn-t-working">here</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, they were <code>192.30.252.153</code> and <code>192.30.252.154</code>. The A record prefix <code>@</code> points to the root of <code>alittleknowledge.net</code>, and the <code>*</code> prefix means any other subdomain will also be directed here (e.g. <code>www.alittleknowledge.net</code>).</p>
<p>In addition, I had to create a file named <code>CNAME</code> at the root of my repository that contains just the domain name <code>alittleknowledge.net</code>.</p>
<p>I pushed this all to the repository, and then added the <code>_site</code> subdirectory to <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<p>For local testing, if I navigate to the root folder and run <code>jekyll build</code>, and then <code>jekyll serve</code>, I can see my site at <code>localhost:4000</code>.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>My guess is that all the 'real' HTML and code lives in the <code>_site</code> directory, and it is this which is served by github. If I wanted to host the site elsewhere, then it would be the contents of this that I would be publishing after using jekyll on my local machine to build it.</p>
