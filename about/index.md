A series of links, and notes loosely related to using observational data to better understand clinical problems in critical care. I have unintentionally [misquoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_Criticism) Alexander Pope in naming this blog:

> A little learning is a dangerous thing;  
> Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.
