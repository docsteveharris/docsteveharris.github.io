Think of the liver as the body's 'glucostat' - takes up glucose when in excess, and releases glucose during fasts.

* Glucose enters all cells and via Hexokinase becomes glucose-6-phosphate; hence maintains a concentration gradient for glucose; it can now enter the Embden-Meyerhof (glycolytic) pathway
* Liver (uniquely) contains glucose-6-phosphatase hence glucose can also be released back into the circulation; other cells can only produce a net return of glucose back to the circulation via lactate and its conversion in the liver back to glucose (Cori cycle)
* Insulin induces glucose-6-phosphatase

### Fed State

* High insulin, blood glucose, low glucagon
* Glucose taken into liver and other cells: glycogen synthesis (G6P via UDP becomes glycogen (branches glucose polymer);
* Acetyl- CoA produces converted into free fatty acids; FFA combined with glycerol (esterification) to form triglycerides (fats as storage)
* Amino acids (some) may be synthesised by amination of various substrates of TCA cycle

### Fasted State

* Low insulin, low blood glucose, high glucagon
* Glycogenolysis - to glucose-1-phosphate; conversion to G6P and release of glucose into circulation
* Fatty acid catabolism: Beta-oxidation produces acetylCoA; 2 carbon (acetyl) fragments from Fatty Acids from Triglycerides are sequentially removed (mitochondrial reaction) with the production of reduced FADH2 and NADH and acetyl-CoA (--> transformed to ketone bodies)
* Gluconeogenesis fr (aa: alanine, glutamine; glycerol; lactate)
* Peripheral lactate converted by liver into glucose (requires oxygen) - (NB: in hypoxia - tissues produce lactate and liver unable to metabolise it - so blood lactate rises)
* Ketogenesis: high rates of FFA beta-oxidation produce more AcetylCoA than can be metabolised by the TCA; furthermore, TCA substrates are not useful to other tissues; instead AcCoA converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone) which can be catabolised by all tissues except the liver back to AcCoA; ketone body formation normally under -ve fb via stimulating insulin release which inhibits ketogenesis; hence in DM - no feedback and uncontrolled ketogenesis
