    <hr>
<p>I was asked by a colleague yesterday if there were any resources on the internet to help learn R. I feel that that should have an answer crafted by someone like <a href="http://xkcd.com/about/">Randall Munroe</a> along the lines of 'What if you tried to count the number of ways there are to learn R'?</p>
<p>Whatever that number is, it's now +1.</p>
<p>I'll start with an unordered list. If we're all lucky, then from time to time, I will try and order it so the good stuff goes to the top.</p>
<h1>Tips</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">R-studio</a> is nice!</li>
<li>Typing <code>&lt;-</code> is annoying if you're used to <code>-</code> as an assignment operator. R-studio has this remapped to <code>option+-</code> (that's 'alt' and the hyphen key together). You can set-up something similar in SublimeText or the text editor of your choice.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Opinion</h1>
<ul>
<li>I don't like the use of the <code>.</code> (dot) as part of variable names. To me, it normally means I am accessing properties of an object. In R, it has no such significance. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Links and handy resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learn R interactively with <a href="http://swirlstats.com/">Swirl</a></li>
</ul>
