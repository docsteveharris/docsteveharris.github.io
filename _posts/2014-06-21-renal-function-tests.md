* Simplest approach to diagnosis are simultaneous Urine/Plasma Na/Cr measurements
* Consider water and Na conservation separately
    * U~Cr~:P~Cr~ < 20 suggests ATN Kidney not conserving water
    * U~Cr~:P~Cr~ > 20 (ideally ~50) if concentrating well)

- High U~Na~ > 20 suggests ATN
    - Calculate FE~Na~
    - Kidney not conserving Na

# Tests of Glomerular Function

## Renal Blood/Plasma Flow

* Use PAH (Para-aminohippurate) b/c clearance is almost 100% (filtration and secretion)
* Hence can assume that renal vein PAH conc is ~0
* Estimate clearance in standard manner
    1. Set up standard plasma conc of PAH with bolus then IVI (aim 2mg/dl)
    2. Timed urinary collection
    3. Take variables: PAH-pl.conc, PAH-ur.conc, Urine volume per unit time
    4. Clearance = (PAH-ur.conc) x (Urine volume) / (PAH-pl.conc) x time
    5. Clearance ~ Renal Plasma flow (since it is almost totally cleared)
    * Then if you know haematocrit then Renal Blood Fow = Clearance / (1-HCT)
    * Normal RBF = 660ml/min/1.73m2

## Glomerular Filtration

* Use Inulin (an inert polyfructose sugar); neither secreted nor reabsorbed by kidney hence Clearance = GFR
* Calculate clearance as above
* Normal Clearance = 125ml/min

## Filtration Fraction

* the fraction of RPF that is filtered; ie GFR/RPF ~ 20%
* Changes with changes in tone of afferent/efferent arterioles

## Creatinine Clearance

* Classically done with a 24hr collection to minimise errors of residual urine in bladder neck; No evidence that this is necessary
* 2hr collection in catheterised patients with Urine flow >15ml/hr equivalent to 12/24hr collections
* Useful in critical care; ie post-op pt with CrCl<25ml/min reliably predicts post-op ARF (even in the abscence of oliguria)
* Creatinine measured by Jaffe reaction (absorption of red colour when alkaline picrate added)
    * Glucose, proteins, ascorbic acid, ketoacids, cephalosporins and barbituates all produce same colour hence tend to underestimate CrCl
    * However as Cr is also secreted by PCT then this means that CrCl is overestimated; clincally the two cancel each other out

# Tests of Tubular Function

* U:P osmolar ratio: olguric urine should be concentrated ie U:P>1.5

## Free water clearance

* the amount of free water that is excreted; Negative numbers mean that H2O is being conserved (ie conc urine); Positive numbers mean loss of free H2O (ie dilute urine)

    1. Calculate the osmolar clearance
        Osmolar clearance: Cl~osm~ = U~osm~ x U~vol~ / P~osm~ per unit time
    2. Free water clearance = Urine Flow - Cl-osm:

## Test of Water Conservation

* Use Creatinine as a marker
    * Urine creatinine should be concentrated if H2O is being conserved
        * U-Cr:P-Cr > 20 (ideally ~50) if concentrating well
        * U-Cr:P-Cr < 20 ... ?ATN / Poorly concentrated urine

## Test of Sodium Conservation

* U-Na < 20 if kidney functioning well
* U-Na > 20 (~60-80) if failing to conserve Na

## Fractional Na Excretion

Comparing Na conservation vs Water (Creatinine is surrogate) conservation

* Ratio Na Clearance: Cr Clearance
    - Because a ratio of two clearances then urine volume cancels out (on the bottom of both equations) so conveniently does not require urine volume measurements
    - Think of it as the sodium conservation: water conservation ratio

* Easily derived to FE~Na~ = (U~Na~ x P~Cr~) / (U~Cr~ x P~Na~)
    * Acute Renal Success FE-Na < 1%
    * FE-Na >3% pathological in well hydrated patient without diuretics
