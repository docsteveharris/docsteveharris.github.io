I have been using Git now for a couple of years, and have struggled to understand what it does. I get the basic concept  (that it keeps a record of the changes I make to my code) but it also sometimes seems to get in the way. I have read [Think like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/epic.html) and  [The thing about git](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git) in the last couple of days and learned a few really useful things.

In no particular order ...

- a free git visualization tool called [GitX](https://github.com/pieter/gitx/wiki/)
- the command line version of the above is `git log --graph --decorate --oneline`
- the idea that git commits can be 'wasted' - you don't need to keep everything or worry about a commit being perfect. Commit if you feel like it.
- `git add --patch` - this is genius. When you are preparing a commit then you don't need to commit an entire file. Running `git add --patch myfilename.here` allows you to run through the diffs in the file and only stage those parts you wish to. This is sort of contradictory to the idea about not worrying too much about your commits in that it permits you to craft the perfect commit (and solve [The Tangled Working Copy Problem](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git)). You can also think of this as a bit of a backwards solution to the classic `git commit --ammend` which allows you to add things you forgot to the previous commit. 
- `git diff --word-diff=color` ... wow! A way to inspect word by word changes in the file. Much better suited to using Git when writing. I should write more about this whole topic! In the meantime, also note
  - type `-S` while viewing the diff to wrap wrong lines and make everything more readable (via [someone45 at StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3107807/992999) ... Thanks!).

Things I still need to get my head around

- cherry picking
- the rebase command

A re-read of [Think like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/epic.html) is in order!
